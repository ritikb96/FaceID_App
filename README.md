# FaceID App â€“ Facial Verification with Siamese Network

This is a facial verification system using a **Siamese Neural Network**. The model determines if two facial images belong to the same person â€” useful for tasks like auto-tagging people in photos, secure login, or event photo filtering.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Capture or upload a selfie**
2. **Compare** with a folder of verification images
3. **Siamese model** predicts similarity scores
4. **If enough matches** are above a threshold â†’ Verified âœ…

## ðŸ§  Model

A **Siamese neural network** is trained to generate similar embeddings for images of the same person and different embeddings for others. The final model is saved as `siamesemodel.h5`.
